Design: Retrospective case-control study. Setting: Large, inner-city public hospital. Participants: All patients aged 19 to 44 years with a diagnosis of stroke, whose HIV status was determined, admitted from January 1990 through June 1994. Controls matched for age and sex were selected from patients who were admitted during the same period for status asthmaticus whose HIV status was known. Main Outcome Measure: The associations of HIV infection with all strokes and with cerebral infarction, after adjustment for other cerebrovascular risk factors, were evaluated by Mantel-Haenszel stratified analyses. The subtypes and causes of stroke in HIV-infected patients were compared with HIV-seronegative patients. Results: The HIV infection was associated with stroke (odds ratio [OR], 23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05.3) and cerebral infarction (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.1-8.9), after adjustment for other cerebrovascular risk factors. Among patients with stroke, cerebral infarction was more frequent in HIV-infected patients than in HIV-seronegative patients (20 [80%] of 25 vs 48 [56%] of 88, P=.04). The frequency of cerebral infarctions associated with meningitis (P<.001) and protein S deficiency (P=06) was higher in HIV- infected patients than in seronegative patients. Conclusions: Our study suggests that HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of stroke, particularly cerebral infarction in young patients. This risk is probably mediated by increased susceptibility of HIV-infected patients to meningitis and protein S deficiency.","Entry Week: 199700; Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed4&AN=1997285378; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Embase&id=pmid:&id=&issn=0003-9942&isbn=&volume=54&issue=9&spage=1150&pages=1150-1153&date=1997&title=Archives+of+Neurology&atitle=Human+immunodeficiency+virus+infection+and+stroke+in+young+patients&aulast=Qureshi&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,"Atlanta, Georgia",USA,CCS,Hospital database,ICD-9,Stroke and Status asthmatics patients,58,35,1990,1994,Stroke,Stroke,OR,0,,3.2,1.1,8.9,,,,25,high,

Although a decrease in overall mortality has been documented, there are no published data on the impact of HAART on causes of death among HIV-infected individuals in Brazil. We assessed temporal trends of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM) and other conditions generally not associated with HIV-infection among persons with and without HIV infection in Brazil between 1999 and 2004. Methodology/Principal Findings: Odds ratios were used to compare causes of death in individuals who had HIV/AIDS listed on any field of the death certificate with those who did not. Logistic regression models were fitted with generalized estimating equations to account for spatial correlation; co-variables were added to the models to control for potential confounding. Of 5,856,056 deaths reported in Brazil between 1999 and 2004 67,249 (1.15%) had HIV/AIDS listed on the death certificate and non-HIV-related conditions were listed on 16.3% in 1999, increasing to 24.1% by 2004 (p<0.001). The adjusted average yearly increases were 8% and 0.8% for CVD (p<0.001), and 12% and 2.8% for DM (p<0.001), for those who had and did not have HIV/AIDS listed on the death certificate, respectively. Similar results were found for these conditions as underlying causes of death. Conclusions/Significance: In Brazil between 1999 and 2004 conditions usually considered not to be related to HIV-infection appeared to become more likely causes of death over time than reported causes of death among individuals who had HIV/AIDS listed on the death certificate than in those who did not. This observation has important programmatic implications for developing countries that are scaling-up access to antiretroviral therapy.",Update Code: 20100000,http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001531; http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=cagh&AN=20103240887; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Global+Health&id=pmid:&id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001531&issn=1932-6203&isbn=&volume=3&issue=January&spage=e1531&pages=e1531&date=2008&title=PLos+One&atitle=Increase+in+non-AIDS+related+conditions+as+causes+of+death+among+HIV-infected+individuals+in+the+HAART+era+in+Brazil.&aulast=Pacheco&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,Brazil,Brazil,Cohort study,National electronic database,ICD-10,>=18 yrs,51,,1999,2004,CVD death,CVD,OR,0,,0.097,,,Data do not seem to be right; CVD in any field of death certificate,,,67249,high,5

This is the first population-based study to quantify the AIDS-associated risk of stroke. Methods-We identified all incident ischemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) cases among young adults 15 to 44 years of age in central Maryland and Washington, DC, who were discharged from any of the 46 hospitals in the study area in 1988 and 1991. Using data from the medical records, 2 neurologists reviewed each case to confirm the diagnosis. Cases of AIDS among these patients with stroke were defined using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria (1987). The number of cases of AIDS in the central Maryland and Washington population during 1988 and 1991 was determined from regional health departments working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Poisson regression was used to estimate the age-, race-, and sex-adjusted relative risk of stroke associated with AIDS. Results-There were 385 IS cases (6 with AIDS) and 171 ICH cases (6 with AIDS). The incidences of IS and ICH among persons with AIDS were both 0.2% per year. AIDS conferred an adjusted relative risk of 13.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1 to 30.8) for IS and 25.5 (95% CI, 11.2 to 58.0) for ICH. After exclusion of 5 cases of stroke in AIDS patients in whom other potential causes were identified, AIDS patients continued to have an increased risk of stroke with an adjusted relative risk of 9.1 (95% CI, 3.4 to 24.6) for IS and 12.7 (95% CI, 4.0 to 40.0) for ICH. Conclusions-This population-based study found that AIDS is strongly associated with both IS and ICH.","Entry Week: 200400; Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed6&AN=2004021728; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Embase&id=pmid:&id=10.1161%2F01.STR.0000105393.57853.11&issn=0039-2499&isbn=&volume=35&issue=1&spage=51&pages=51-56&date=2004&title=Stroke&atitle=Acquired+Immunodeficiency+Syndrome+and+the+Risk+of+Stroke&aulast=Cole&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,BW-CYSS,USA,Cohort study,Hospital database,ICD-9,AIDS patients; 15-44 yo,83,35.3,1988,1991,Stroke,Stroke,RR,1,"age, sex, race",13.7,6.1,30.8,AIDS vs No AIDS (=mostly HIV-),,,557,moderate,

Methods All adult HIV patients treated in Danish HIV centers from 1995 to 2008 and 14 controls for each HIV patient were included. Age-adjusted mortality rates (MR) and mortality rate ratios (MRR) were estimated using direct standardization and Poisson regression analyses. Up to four contributory causes of death for each person were included in analyses of cause-specific MR. Results A total of 5,137 HIV patients and 71,918 controls were followed for 37,838 and 671,339 person-years (PY), respectively. Among non-injection drug use (IDU) HIV patients, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related MR/1,000 PY declined dramatically from 122.9 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 106.8-141.4] in 1995 to 5.0 (95 % CI 3.1-8.1) in 2008. The non-AIDSrelated MR did not change substantially from 6.9 (95 % CI 3.8-12.5) to 5.6 (95 % CI 3.6-8.8). The MR of unnatural causes declined from 6.9 (95 % CI 3.8-12.5) to 2.7 (95 % CI 1.4-5.1). The MRR of infections declined from 46.6 (95 % CI 19.6-110.9) to 3.3 (95 % CI 1.6-6.6). The MRR of other natural causes of death remained constant. Conclusions After the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the AIDS-related mortality has decreased substantially, but the long-term exposure to HIV and HAART has not translated into increasing mortality from malignancy, cardiovascular, and hepatic diseases. â© Springer-Verlag 2012.","Entry Week: 201310; Copyright 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&AN=2013118033; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Embase&id=pmid:&id=10.1007%2Fs15010-012-0293-y&issn=0300-8126&isbn=&volume=40&issue=6&spage=627&pages=627-634&date=2012&title=Infection&atitle=Causes+of+death+among+Danish+HIV+patients+compared+with+population+controls+in+the+period+1995-2008&aulast=Helleberg&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,Danish HIV,Denmark,Cohort study,"Danish Civil Registration System, National registry of cause of death",ICD-10,>16 yo,75.8,36,,,Mortality - CV,CVD,RR,1,"age, sex",2.5,2,3.1,,,,5137,moderate,7.1

A CD4 cell count of 200 cells/ micro l or less before the start of HAART and exposure to abacavir increased the risk of CVE [(adjusted IRR 2.26; 95% CI 1.05-4.86) and (adjusted IRR 1.66; 95% CI 1.03-2.68)]. Protease inhibitors, indinavir, didanosin, tenofovir and HAART in general had no impact. Risk of CVEs was only increased in the parents of IDU HIV-infected individuals. Conclusion: HIV-infected individuals have an increased risk of CVEs with and without proven risk factors. The risk is associated with IDU, low CD4 cell count and exposure to abacavir, but not with HAART. An association with family-related risk factors seems vague except for parents of IDU individuals.",CAS Registry Numbers: 136470-78-5 69655-05-6 150378-17-9 147127-20-6; Update Code: 20110000,http://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/; http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=cagh&AN=20113295640; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Global+Health&id=pmid:&id=10.1097%2FQAD.0b013e3283493fb0&issn=0269-9370&isbn=&volume=25&issue=13&spage=1637&pages=1637-1646&date=2011&title=AIDS&atitle=Risk+of+cerebrovascular+events+in+persons+with+and+without+HIV%3A+a+Danish+nationwide+population-based+cohort+study.&aulast=Rasmussen&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,Danish HIV,Denmark,Cohort study,"Danish Civil Registration System, National registry of cause of death",ICD-8/ICD-10/KFNA00-KFNG96,>16 yo,77.3,36.9,1995,2010,Stroke - Non IDU,,RR,1,"age, sex, country of birth",1.63,1.1,2.41,Non-IDU; proportion give,,,5031,,7.6

The French Hospital Database on HIV, which includes a large number of seropositive subjects followed for substantial periods, offers the opportunity to analyse the impact of protease inhibitors (PI) on the risk of MI among men. Methods: Cox model was used to study the risk factors of MI occurrence. Standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) in men exposed to PI were calculated with data from the French general male population (FGMP) of the same age as reference. Results: Between 1996 and 1999, MI was diagnosed in 60 men among 88 029 person-years (PY), including 49 cases among men exposed to PI. In the Cox model, exposure to PI was associated with a higher risk of MI [relative hazard (RH), 2.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-6.34]. The expected incidence in the FGMP was 10.8/10 000 PY. The SMR relative to the FGMP was 0.8 (95% CI, 0.5-1.3) for men exposed to PI for  30 months (G3). With G1 as reference, the SMR was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.0-3.1) for G2 and 3.6 (95% CI, 1.8-6.2) for G3. Conclusion: Our results point to a duration-related effect relationship between PI and MI, with a higher MI incidence rate among men exposed to PI for 18 months or more. â© 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","CAS Registry Numbers: 37205-61-1 (proteinase inhibitor); Entry Week: 200400; Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed6&AN=2004140996; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Embase&id=pmid:&id=10.1097%2F00002030-200311210-00010&issn=0269-9370&isbn=&volume=17&issue=17&spage=2479&pages=2479-2486&date=2003&title=AIDS&atitle=Increased+risk+of+myocardial+infarction+with+duration+of+protease+inhibitor+therapy+in+HIV-infected+men&aulast=Mary-Krause&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,FHDH,France,Cohort study,clinical database,ICD-9/10,Men,100,38,1996,1999,Incidence - MI,MI,RR,1,sex,0.63,,,Ratio calculated from an estimated rate for general male population with same age distribution,,,34976,moderate,2.5

Methods: The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) is an ongoing prospective study of HIV+ and HIV-men who have sex with men (MSM) enrolled in 4 US cities. We ascertained all reported stroke events during a recent 15-year timeframe (July 1, 1996 to June 30, 2011) among 3,945 participants (1,776 HIV+ and 2,169 HIV-). For those with strokes, FRS-S were calculated 10 years before the stroke event and assessed according to HIV status. Results: A total of 114 stroke events occurred, including 57 HIV+ and 37 HIV-participants with first-ever strokes and 19 fatal strokes. The incidence of first-ever stroke was 1.7/1,000 personyears among HIV- and 3.3/1,000 person-years among HIV+ participants. Among those with strokes, HIV+participants were younger than HIV-participants (median age 51.3 vs 61.8 years, < 0.0001). For these men with stroke, the average 10-year risk of stroke was higher for HIV-MSM (6.6% [range 3%-26%] vs 4.9% for HIV+ MSM [range 0%-15%], < 0.04). Traditional risk factors for stroke were similar among the Framingham cohort and the MACS HIV+ and HIV-participants. Conclusions: FRS-S prediction was systematically different in HIV+ vs HIV-men with stroke events. The FRS-S underestimates the long-term risk of stroke in HIV+ men. â© 2013 American Academy of Neurology.","CAS Registry Numbers: 8001-45-4 (cannabis); 8063-14-7 (cannabis); Entry Week: 201404; Copyright 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed12&AN=2014031337; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Embase&id=pmid:&id=10.1212%2F01.wnl.0000437296.97946.73&issn=0028-3878&isbn=&volume=81&issue=24&spage=2094&pages=2094-2102&date=2013&title=Neurology&atitle=Long-term+predictive+value+of+the+Framingham+Risk+Score+for+Stroke+in+HIV-positive+vs+HIV-negative+men&aulast=Mateen&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,MACS,USA,Cohort study,MACS database,ICD-9,MSM,100,41,1996,2011,Incidence - Stroke,Stroke,HR,1,"age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, sys bp, cvd",2.16,1.39,3.31,Self-reported stroke included!,,,1776,low,

Methods: Mortality by cause of death was analyzed for the period 1999-2006 in the cohort of persons aged 20-59 years diagnosed with HIV infection and residing in Navarre (Spain). This was compared with mortality from the same causes in the general population of the same age and sex using standardized mortality ratios (SMR). Results: There were 210 deaths among 1145 persons diagnosed with HIV (29.5 per 1000 person-years). About 50% of these deaths were from AIDS. Persons diagnosed with HIV infection had exceeded all-cause mortality (SMR 14.0, 95% CI 12.2 to 16.1) and non-AIDS mortality (SMR 6.9, 5.7 to 8.5). The analysis showed excess mortality from hepatic disease (SMR 69.0, 48.1 to 78.6), drug overdose or addiction (SMR 46.0, 29.2 to 69.0), suicide (SMR 9.6, 3.8 to 19.7), cancer (SMR 3.2, 1.8 to 5.1) and cardiovascular disease (SMR 3.1, 1.3 to 6.1). Mortality in HIV-infected intravenous drug users did not change significantly between the periods 1999-2002 and 2003-2006, but it declined by 56% in non-injecting drug users (P=0.007). Conclusions: Persons with HIV infection continue to have considerable excess mortality despite the availability of effective antiretroviral treatments.

We aimed to study the impact of HIV and of antiretrovirals on acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods: We performed a cohort and a nested case-control study using the dataset of the Regie de l'Assurance Maladie du Quebec. HIV-positive patients were identified using ICD-9 diagnostic codes and matched to HIV-negative patients. Within the HIV-positive cohort, cases of AMI were identified and matched to HIV-positive patients without AMI. The coprimary outcomes were the risk of AMI associated with HIV exposure in the cohort study and that associated with exposure to antiretrovirals in the case-control study. Data were analysed using Poisson and conditional logistic regression. Results: About 7053 HIV-positive patients were matched to 27,681 HIV-negative patients. Incidence rates of AMI in the HIV+ cohort was 3.88 95% confidence interval (CI) (3.26 to 4.58) per 1000 patient-years, compared to 2.21 95% CI (1.93 to 2.52) per 1000 patient-years in the HIV cohort. The adjusted incidence ratio of AMI for HIV-infected patients was 2.11 95%CI (1.69 to 2.63). Among HIV+ patients, 125 AMI cases were matched with 1084 HIV+ patients. We found increased odds ratio (95% CI) of AMI associated with any exposure to abacavir 1.79 (1.16 to 2.76), P = 0.02, efavirenz 1.83 (1.21 to 2.76) P = 0.004, lopinavir 1.98 (1.24 to 3.16) P = 0.004, and ritonavir 2.29 (1.48 to 3.54) P < 0.001. Conclusions: HIV+ individuals were at higher risk of AMI than the general population, and several antiretrovirals were associated with an increased risk of AMI.

METHODS: Analyses included patients receiving care in the Partners HealthCare System between January 1997 and December 2006, with a most recent CRP less than 3 years and more than 1 week before AMI. Over this period, 70,357 (487 HIV and 69,870 non-HIV) patients met these criteria, from the background population of 1,648,687 patients followed in the system. We included both CRP and high-sensitivity CRP and defined elevated CRP based on the normal range of the assay used. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to test the association of elevated CRP and HIV with AMI after adjustment for demographic and other cardiovascular covariates, including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. RESULTS: In univariate analyses, elevated CRP and HIV were each significantly associated with AMI [odds ratio (OR) 2.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.27 to 2.78; P < 0.0001 for elevated CRP and OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.31 to 3.10; P = 0.001 for HIV]. In a combined model including CRP category and HIV status, elevated CRP (OR 2.50; 95% CI 2.26 to 2.77; P < 0.0001) and HIV (OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.61; P = 0.01) were both independently associated with AMI. In a fully adjusted model controlling for age, sex, race, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, both elevated CRP (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.92 to 2.37; P < 0.0001) and HIV (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.93; P = 0.004) remained independently associated with AMI. Compared with patients with normal CRP and without HIV, the OR for AMI was increased more than 4-fold among patients with HIV and elevated CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CRP and HIV are independently associated with increased AMI risk, and patients with HIV with increased CRP have a markedly increased relative risk of AMI. Measurement of CRP may be useful in the cardiovascular risk assessment of patients with HIV. â© 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","CAS Registry Numbers: 9007-41-4 (C reactive protein); Entry Week: 200900; Copyright 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed9&AN=2009381131; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Embase&id=pmid:&id=10.1097%2FQAI.0b013e3181a9992c&issn=1525-4135&isbn=&volume=51&issue=3&spage=268&pages=268-273&date=2009&title=Journal+of+Acquired+Immune+Deficiency+Syndromes&atitle=Association+of+C-reactive+protein+and+HIV+infection+with+acute+myocardial+infarction&aulast=Triant&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,RPDR,USA,Cohort study,Clinical data registry,ICD-9,>=18 yo,62.8,38,1997,2006,MI,MI,OR,1,"age, sex, ethnicity, CRP, comorbidities",1.93,1.21,2.93,,,,70357,low,6

We sought to compare stroke rates and determine stroke risk factors in HIV-infected versus non-HIV-infected patients. Methods: An HIV cohort and matched non-HIV comparator cohort seen between 1996 and 2009 were identified from a Boston health care system. The primary endpoint was ischemic stroke, defined using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Unadjusted stroke incidence rates were calculated. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to determine adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). Results: The incidence rate of ischemic stroke was 5.27 per 1000 person-years in HIV-infected compared with 3.75 in non-HIV-infected patients, with an unadjusted HR of 1.40 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17 to 1.69, P<0.001]. HIV remained an independent predictor of stroke after controlling for demographics and stroke risk factors (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.46, P=0.043). The relative increase in stroke rates (HIV vs. non-HIV) was significantly higher in younger HIV patients (incidence rate ratio: 4.42, 95% CI: 1.56 to 11.09, age 18-29; 2.96, 1.69-4.96, age: 30-39; 1.53, 1.06-2.17, age: 40-49), and in women [HR: 2.16 (95% CI: 1.53 to 3.04) for women vs. HR: 1.18 (95% CI: 0.95 to 1.47) for men]. Among HIV patients, increased HIV RNA (HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.17, P=0.001) was associated with an increased risk of stroke. Conclusions: Stroke rates were increased among HIV-infected patients, independent of common stroke risk factors, particularly among young patients and women.",Update Code: 20120831,http://journals.lww.com/jaids/Abstract/2012/08010/Comparison_of_Ischemic_Stroke_Incidence_in.3.aspx; http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=cagh&AN=20123246737; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Global+Health&id=pmid:&id=&issn=1525-4135&isbn=&volume=60&issue=4&spage=351&pages=351-358&date=2012&title=JAIDS%2C+Journal+of+Acquired+Immune+Deficiency+Syndromes&atitle=Comparison+of+ischemic+stroke+incidence+in+HIV-infected+and+non-HIV-infected+patients+in+a+US+health+care+system.&aulast=Chow&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,RPDR,USA,Cohort study,Research Patient Data Registry,ICD-9,,69,41.6,1996,2009,Incidence - Stroke,Stroke,HR,1,"age, sex, race",1.21,1.01,1.46,,,,4308,moderate,5.9

However, high-quality data for modifiable stroke risk factors in sub-Saharan Africa are scarce, with no communitybased, case-control studies previously published. We aimed to identify risk factors for stroke in an incident population from rural and urban Tanzania. Methods Stroke cases from urban Dar-es-Salaam and the rural Hai district were recruited in a wider study of stroke incidence between June 15, 2003, and June 15, 2006. We included cases with first-ever and recurrent stroke. Community-acquired controls recruited from the background census populations of the two study regions were matched with cases for age and sex and were interviewed and assessed. Data relating to medical and social history were recorded and blood samples taken. Findings We included 200 stroke cases (69 from Dar-es-Salaam and 131 from Hai) and 398 controls (138 from Dar-es- Salaam and 260 from Hai). Risk factors were similar at both sites, with previous cardiac event (odds ratio [OR] 739, 95% CI 242-2253; p<00001), HIV infection (561, 241-1309; p<00001), a high ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol (454, 249-828; p<00001), smoking (272, 149-496; p=0001), and hypertension (214, 109-417; p=0026) identified as significant independent risk factors for stroke. In Hai, additional risk factors of diabetes (404, 129-1264) and low HDL cholesterol (984, 406-2384) were also significant. Interpretation We have identified many of the risk factors for stroke already reported for other world regions. HIV status was an independent risk factor for stroke within an antiretroviral-naive population. Clinicians should be aware of the increased risk of stroke in people with HIV, even in the absence of antiretroviral treatment.","Entry Week: 201350; Copyright 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&AN=2013738842; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Embase&id=pmid:&id=10.1016%2FS2214-109X%252813%252970068-8&issn=2214-109X&isbn=&volume=1&issue=5&spage=e282&pages=e282-e288&date=2013&title=The+Lancet+Global+Health&atitle=Stroke+risk+factors+in+an+incident+population+in+urban+and+rural+Tanzania%3A+A+prospective%2C+community-based%2C+case-control+study&aulast=Walker&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,Tanzania,Tanzania,CCS,verbal autopsy,WHO definition,Stroke as Cases,55,61.5,2003,2006,Stroke,Stroke,OR,1,"previous event, smoking, hypertension, alcohol, diabetes",5.61,2.41,13.09,Many data missing,,,598,low,3

Although it has been shown that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults are at greater risk for aging-associated events, it remains unclear as to whether these events happen at similar, or younger ages, in HIV-infected compared with uninfected adults. The objective of this study was to compare the median age at, and risk of, incident diagnosis of 3 age-associated diseases in HIV-infected and demographically similar uninfected adults. Methods. The study was nested in the clinical prospective Veterans Aging Cohort Study of HIV-infected and demographically matched uninfected veterans, from 1 April 2003 to 31 December 2010. The outcomes were validated diagnoses of myocardial infarction (MI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and non-AIDS-defining cancer (NADC). Differences in mean age at, and risk of, diagnosis by HIV status were estimated using multivariate linear regression models and Cox proportional hazards models, respectively. Results. A total of 98 687 (31% HIV-infected and 69% uninfected) adults contributed >450 000 person-years and 689 MI, 1135 ESRD, and 4179 NADC incident diagnoses. Mean age at MI (adjusted mean difference, -0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], -.59 to .37 years) and NADC (adjusted mean difference, -0.10 [95% CI, -.30 to .10] years) did not differ by HIV status. HIV-infected adults were diagnosed with ESRD at an average age of 5.5 months younger than uninfected adults (adjusted mean difference, -0.46 [95% CI, -.86 to -.07] years). HIV-infected adults had a greater risk of all 3 outcomes compared with uninfected adults after accounting for important confounders. Conclusions. HIV-infected adults had a higher risk of these age-associated events, but they occurred at similar ages than those without HIV.",Update Code: 20150401,http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/4/627.full; http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=cagh&AN=20153094116; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Global+Health&id=pmid:&id=10.1093%2Fcid%2Fciu869&issn=1058-4838&isbn=&volume=60&issue=4&spage=627&pages=627-638&date=2015&title=Clinical+Infectious+Diseases&atitle=Comparison+of+risk+and+age+at+diagnosis+of+myocardial+infarction%2C+end-stage+renal+disease%2C+and+non-AIDS-defining+cancer+in+HIV-infected+versus+uninfected+adults.&aulast=Althoff&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,VACS,USA,Cohort study,MediCare/ IHD Quality Enhancement Initiative,ICD-9,Veterans,,48,2003,2010,Incidence - MI,MI,HR,1,"age, race, BMI, smoking and other comorbities",1.76,1.49,2.07,,,,27253,low,5.3

This is the first population-based study to quantify the AIDS-associated risk of stroke. Methods-We identified all incident ischemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) cases among young adults 15 to 44 years of age in central Maryland and Washington, DC, who were discharged from any of the 46 hospitals in the study area in 1988 and 1991. Using data from the medical records, 2 neurologists reviewed each case to confirm the diagnosis. Cases of AIDS among these patients with stroke were defined using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria (1987). The number of cases of AIDS in the central Maryland and Washington population during 1988 and 1991 was determined from regional health departments working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Poisson regression was used to estimate the age-, race-, and sex-adjusted relative risk of stroke associated with AIDS. Results-There were 385 IS cases (6 with AIDS) and 171 ICH cases (6 with AIDS). The incidences of IS and ICH among persons with AIDS were both 0.2% per year.

There are concerns about highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) causing a progressive increase in the risk of ischemic heart disease. We examined this issue in a nationwide cohort study of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and a population-based control group. Methods. We determined the rate of first hospitalization for ischemic heart disease in all Danish patients with HIV infection (3953 patients) from 1 January 1995 through 31 December 2004 and compared this rate with that for 373,856 subjects in a population-based control group. Data on first hospitalization for ischemic heart disease and comorbidity were obtained from the Danish National Hospital Registry for all study participants. We used Cox's regression to compute the hospitalization rate ratio as an estimate of relative risk, adjusting for comorbidity. Results. Although the difference was not statistically significant, patients with HIV infection who had not initiated HAART were slightly more likely to be hospitalized for the first time with ischemic heart disease than were control subjects (adjusted relative risk, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-2.33). After HAART initiation, the risk increase became substantially higher (adjusted relative risk, 2.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.62-2.76), but the relative risk did not further increase in the initial 8 years of HAART. Conclusions. Compared with the general population, HIV-infected patients receiving HAART have an increased risk of ischemic heart disease, but the relative risk is stable up to 8 years after treatment initiation.",Update Code: 20070000,http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/CID/journal/home.html; http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=cagh&AN=20073154218; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Global+Health&id=pmid:&id=10.1086%2F518285&issn=1058-4838&isbn=&volume=44&issue=12&spage=1625&pages=1625-1631&date=2007&title=Clinical+Infectious+Diseases&atitle=Ischemic+heart+disease+in+HIV-infected+and+HIV-uninfected+individuals%3A+a+population-based+cohort+study.&aulast=Obel&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,Danish HIV,Denmark,Cohort study,"Danish Civil Registration System, National registry of cause of death",ICD-8/ICD-10/KFNA00-KFNG96,>16 yo,76.8,36.8,1995,2004,CHD hospitalisation,,RR,0,,,,,RR given for non-HAART and HAART period; Ratio calculated,I calculated 1.72,,3953,,9

Human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals have increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI); however, the contribution from smoking and potentiating effects of HIV are controversial. Methods. From the Danish HIV Cohort Study and the Copenhagen General Population Study, we identified 3251 HIV-infected individuals and 13 004 population controls matched on age and gender. Data on MI were obtained from the National Hospital Registry and the National Registry of Causes of Death. We calculated adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) for risk of MI and population-attributable fractions (PAF) of MI associated with smoking. Results. In never smokers, HIV was not associated with an increased risk of MI (aIRR, 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], .41-2.54). In previous and current smokers, HIV was associated with a substantially increased risk of MI (aIRR, 1.78; 95% CI, .75-4.24 and aIRR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.71-4.70).

Smoking is associated with a higher risk of MI in the HIV-infected population than in the general population. Approximately 3 of 4 MIs among HIV-infected individuals are associated with ever smoking compared with only 1 of 4 MIs among population controls.

This ongoing observational study examines CHD and myocardial infarction (MI) hospitalization rates among HIV-positive members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California, before and after PI use, and before and after any antiretroviral therapy (ART). Also, CHD and MI hospitalization rates among HIV-infected members are compared with members not known to be HIV-positive. With 4.1 years' median total follow-up, age-adjusted CHD and MI hospitalization rates were not significantly different before versus after PIs (6.2 vs. 6.7 events per 1000 person-years); or before versus after ART (5.7 vs. 6.8). However, comparing HIV-positive and -negative members, the CHD hospitalization rate was significantly higher (6.5 vs. 3.8, p = .003), and the difference in the MI rate also was higher (4.3 vs. 2.9, p = .07). Differences between HIV-positive and -negative members in the CHD risk factors measured were mixed, and the overall clinical significance of these differences is uncertain. Our data suggest that PIs and other antiretroviral therapies do not yet increase CHD or MI hospitalizations among HIV-infected individuals; however, longer follow-up is needed.

Design: Cohort study of HIV-positive and matched HIV-negative adult Kaiser Permanente Northern and Southern California (KPNC and KPSC, respectively) members during 1996-2011 (KPNC) or 2000-2011 (KPSC). Methods: We used Poisson models to obtain rate ratios for incident ischemic stroke associated with HIV infection, both overall and stratified by CD4+ cell counts (cells/mul) and HIV RNA copies (copies/ml), with HIV-negative individuals as the reference group. We also obtained rate ratios for risk factors in the HIV-positive subset. Results: Among 24 768 HIV-positive and 257 600 HIV-negative individuals, the ischemic stroke rate per 100 000 person-years was 125 (n=151 events) for HIV-positive and 74 (n=1128 events) for HIV-negative individuals, with an adjusted rate ratio of 1.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.7).

Design: Cohort study of HIV-positive and matched HIV-negative adult Kaiser Permanente Northern and Southern California (KPNC and KPSC, respectively) members during 1996-2011 (KPNC) or 2000-2011 (KPSC).

Methods: The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study is a prospective study of men who have sex with men enrolled in 4 cities in the United States. We compared HIV-positive vs HIV-negative men for incidence and category of neurologic diagnoses in the HAART era (July 1, 1996, to last known follow-up or death, on or before July 1, 2011). Results: There were 3,945 participants alive during the HAART era (2,083 HIV negative, 1,776 HIV positive, and 86 who became infected with HIV during the study period) including 3,427 who were older than 40 years of age. Median age at first neurologic diagnosis among all participants alive in the HAART era was lower in HAART-treated HIV-positive vs HIV-negative men (48 vs 57 years of age, p < 0.001). Incidence of neurologic diagnoses was higher in HAART-treated HIVpositive vs HIV-negative men (younger than 40 years: 11.4 vs 0 diagnoses per 1,000 personyears [p < 0.001]; 40-49 years: 11.6 vs 2.0 [p < 0.001]; 50-60 years: 15.1 vs 3.0 [p < 0.001]; older than 60 years: 17.0 vs 5.7 [p < 0.01]). Excess neurologic disease was found in the categories of nervous system infections (p < 0.001), dementia (p < 0.001), seizures/epilepsy (p < 0.01), and peripheral nervous system disorders (p < 0.001), but not stroke (p = 0.60).

We aimed to study the impact of HIV and of antiretrovirals on acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods: We performed a cohort and a nested case-control study using the dataset of the Regie de l'Assurance Maladie du Quebec. HIV-positive patients were identified using ICD-9 diagnostic codes and matched to HIV-negative patients. Within the HIV-positive cohort, cases of AMI were identified and matched to HIV-positive patients without AMI. The coprimary outcomes were the risk of AMI associated with HIV exposure in the cohort study and that associated with exposure to antiretrovirals in the case-control study. Data were analysed using Poisson and conditional logistic regression. Results: About 7053 HIV-positive patients were matched to 27,681 HIV-negative patients. Incidence rates of AMI in the HIV+ cohort was 3.88 95% confidence interval (CI) (3.26 to 4.58) per 1000 patient-years, compared to 2.21 95% CI (1.93 to 2.52) per 1000 patient-years in the HIV cohort. The adjusted incidence ratio of AMI for HIV-infected patients was 2.11 95%CI (1.69 to 2.63). Among HIV+ patients, 125 AMI cases were matched with 1084 HIV+ patients. We found increased odds ratio (95% CI) of AMI associated with any exposure to abacavir 1.79 (1.16 to 2.76), P = 0.02, efavirenz 1.83 (1.21 to 2.76) P = 0.004, lopinavir 1.98 (1.24 to 3.16) P = 0.004, and ritonavir 2.29 (1.48 to 3.54) P < 0.001. Conclusions: HIV+ individuals were at higher risk of AMI than the general population, and several antiretrovirals were associated with an increased risk of AMI.

Objective: The aim of the study was to determine acute myocardial infarction (AMI) rates and cardiovascular risk factors in HIV compared with non-HIV patients in two tertiary care hospitals. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a health care system-based cohort study using a large data registry with 3,851 HIV and 1,044,589 non-HIV patients. AMI rates were determined among patients receiving longitudinal care between October 1, 1996, and June 30, 2004. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was myocardial infarction, identified by International Classification of Diseases coding criteria. Results: AMI was identified in 189 HIV and 26,142 non-HIV patients. AMI rates per 1000 person-years were increased in HIV vs. non-HIV patients [11.13 (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.58-12.68) vs. 6.98 (95% CI 6.89-7.06)]. The HIV cohort had significantly higher proportions of hypertension (21.2 vs. 15.9%), diabetes (11.5 vs. 6.6%), and dyslipidemia (23.3 vs. 17.6%) than the non-HIV cohort (P < 0.0001 for each comparison). The difference in AMI rates between HIV and non-HIV patients was significant, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.75 (95% CI 1.51-2.02; P < 0.0001), adjusting for age, gender, race, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. In gender-stratified models, the unadjusted AMI rates per 1000 person-years were higher for HIV patients among women (12.71 vs. 4.88 for HIV compared with non-HIV women), but not among men (10.48 vs. 11.44 for HIV compared with non-HIV men). The RRs (for HIV vs. non-HIV) were 2.98 (95% CI 2.33-3.75; P < 0.0001) for women and 1.40 (95% CI 1.16-1.67; P = 0.0003) for men, adjusting for age, gender, race, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. A limitation of this database is that it contains incomplete data on smoking. Smoking could not be included in the overall regression model, and some of the increased risk may be accounted for by differences in smoking rates. Conclusions: AMI rates and cardiovascular risk factors were increased in HIV compared with non-HIV patients, particularly among women. Cardiac risk modification strategies are important for the long-term care of HIV patients.

Objective: The aim of the study was to determine acute myocardial infarction (AMI) rates and cardiovascular risk factors in HIV compared with non-HIV patients in two tertiary care hospitals. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a health care system-based cohort study using a large data registry with 3,851 HIV and 1,044,589 non-HIV patients. AMI rates were determined among patients receiving longitudinal care between October 1, 1996, and June 30, 2004. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was myocardial infarction, identified by International Classification of Diseases coding criteria. Results: AMI was identified in 189 HIV and 26,142 non-HIV patients. AMI rates per 1000 person-years were increased in HIV vs. non-HIV patients [11.13 (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.58-12.68) vs. 6.98 (95% CI 6.89-7.06)]. The HIV cohort had significantly higher proportions of hypertension (21.2 vs. 15.9%), diabetes (11.5 vs. 6.6%), and dyslipidemia (23.3 vs. 17.6%) than the non-HIV cohort (P < 0.0001 for each comparison). The difference in AMI rates between HIV and non-HIV patients was significant, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.75 (95% CI 1.51-2.02; P < 0.0001), adjusting for age, gender, race, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.

METHODS: Analyses included patients receiving care in the Partners HealthCare System between January 1997 and December 2006, with a most recent CRP less than 3 years and more than 1 week before AMI. Over this period, 70,357 (487 HIV and 69,870 non-HIV) patients met these criteria, from the background population of 1,648,687 patients followed in the system. We included both CRP and high-sensitivity CRP and defined elevated CRP based on the normal range of the assay used. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to test the association of elevated CRP and HIV with AMI after adjustment for demographic and other cardiovascular covariates, including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. RESULTS: In univariate analyses, elevated CRP and HIV were each significantly associated with AMI [odds ratio (OR) 2.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.27 to 2.78; P < 0.0001 for elevated CRP and OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.31 to 3.10; P = 0.001 for HIV]. In a combined model including CRP category and HIV status, elevated CRP (OR 2.50; 95% CI 2.26 to 2.77; P < 0.0001) and HIV (OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.61; P = 0.01) were both independently associated with AMI. In a fully adjusted model controlling for age, sex, race, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, both elevated CRP (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.92 to 2.37; P < 0.0001) and HIV (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.93; P = 0.004) remained independently associated with AMI. Compared with patients with normal CRP and without HIV, the OR for AMI was increased more than 4-fold among patients with HIV and elevated CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CRP and HIV are independently associated with increased AMI risk, and patients with HIV with increased CRP have a markedly increased relative risk of AMI. Measurement of CRP may be useful in the cardiovascular risk assessment of patients with HIV. â© 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","CAS Registry Numbers: 9007-41-4 (C reactive protein); Entry Week: 200900; Copyright 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed9&AN=2009381131; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Embase&id=pmid:&id=10.1097%2FQAI.0b013e3181a9992c&issn=1525-4135&isbn=&volume=51&issue=3&spage=268&pages=268-273&date=2009&title=Journal+of+Acquired+Immune+Deficiency+Syndromes&atitle=Association+of+C-reactive+protein+and+HIV+infection+with+acute+myocardial+infarction&aulast=Triant&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,RPDR,USA,Cohort study,Clinical data registry,ICD-9,>=18 yo,62.8,38,1997,2006,MI,,OR,0,,2.07,1.31,3.1,,,,70357,,6

United States of America.","Background: Cardiovascular disease is increased among HIV-infected patients, but little is known regarding ischemic stroke rates. We sought to compare stroke rates and determine stroke risk factors in HIV-infected versus non-HIV-infected patients. Methods: An HIV cohort and matched non-HIV comparator cohort seen between 1996 and 2009 were identified from a Boston health care system. The primary endpoint was ischemic stroke, defined using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Unadjusted stroke incidence rates were calculated. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to determine adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). Results: The incidence rate of ischemic stroke was 5.27 per 1000 person-years in HIV-infected compared with 3.75 in non-HIV-infected patients, with an unadjusted HR of 1.40 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17 to 1.69, P<0.001]. HIV remained an independent predictor of stroke after controlling for demographics and stroke risk factors (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.46, P=0.043). The relative increase in stroke rates (HIV vs. non-HIV) was significantly higher in younger HIV patients (incidence rate ratio: 4.42, 95% CI: 1.56 to 11.09, age 18-29; 2.96, 1.69-4.96, age: 30-39; 1.53, 1.06-2.17, age: 40-49), and in women [HR: 2.16 (95% CI: 1.53 to 3.04) for women vs. HR: 1.18 (95% CI: 0.95 to 1.47) for men]. Among HIV patients, increased HIV RNA (HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.17, P=0.001) was associated with an increased risk of stroke. Conclusions: Stroke rates were increased among HIV-infected patients, independent of common stroke risk factors, particularly among young patients and women.",Update Code: 20120831,http://journals.lww.com/jaids/Abstract/2012/08010/Comparison_of_Ischemic_Stroke_Incidence_in.3.aspx; http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=cagh&AN=20123246737; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Global+Health&id=pmid:&id=&issn=1525-4135&isbn=&volume=60&issue=4&spage=351&pages=351-358&date=2012&title=JAIDS%2C+Journal+of+Acquired+Immune+Deficiency+Syndromes&atitle=Comparison+of+ischemic+stroke+incidence+in+HIV-infected+and+non-HIV-infected+patients+in+a+US+health+care+system.&aulast=Chow&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,RPDR,USA,Cohort study,Research Patient Data Registry,ICD-9,,69,41.6,1996,2009,Incidence - Stroke,,HR,0,,1.4,1.17,1.69,,,,4308,,5.9

Compared to uninfected people, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals may have an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Currently, HIV-infected people are treated to the same blood pressure (BP) goals (<140/90 or <130/80 mm Hg) as their uninfected counterparts. Whether HIV-infected people with elevated BP have excess AMI risk compared to uninfected people is not known. This study examines whether the association between elevated BP and AMI risk differs by HIV status.Methods. The Veterans Aging Cohort Study Virtual Cohort (VACS VC) consists of HIV-infected and-uninfected veterans matched 1:2 on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and clinical site. For this analysis, we analyzed 81 026 people with available BP data from VACS VC, who were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. BP was the average of the 3 routine outpatient clinical measurements performed closest to baseline (first clinical visit after April 2003). BP categories used in the analyses were based on criteria of the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression.Results. Over 5.9 years (median), 860 incident AMIs occurred. Low/high prehypertensive and untreated/treated hypertensive HIV-infected individuals had increased AMI risk compared to uninfected, untreated normotensive individuals (hazard ratio [HR], 1.60 [95% confidence interval CI, 1.07-2.39]; HR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.22-2.68]; HR, 2.57 [95% CI, 1.76-3.76]; and HR, 2.76 [95% CI, 1.90-4.02], respectively). Conclusions. HIV, prehypertensive BP, and hypertensive BP were associated with an increased risk of AMI in a cohort of HIV-infected and-uninfected veterans. Future studies should prospectively investigate whether HIV interacts with BP to further increase AMI risk. â© 2013 The Author.","CAS Registry Numbers: 9008-02-0 (hemoglobin); Entry Week: 201403; Copyright 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed12&AN=2014002768; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Embase&id=pmid:&id=10.1093%2Fcid%2Fcit652&issn=1058-4838&isbn=&volume=58&issue=1&spage=121&pages=121-129&date=2014&title=Clinical+Infectious+Diseases&atitle=Prehypertension%2C+hypertension%2C+and+the+risk+of+acute+myocardial+infarction+in+HIV-infected+and-uninfected+veterans&aulast=Armah&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,VACS,USA,Cohort study,MediCare/ IHD Quality Enhancement Initiative,ICD-9,Veterans,,48,2003,2009,MI,,RR,0,,1.44,,,Calculated RR,,,26836,,5.9

Outcome-Incident AMI [defined using enzyme, electrocardiogram (EKG) clinical data, 410 inpatient ICD-9 (Medicare), and/or death certificates]. Statistics-Cox models adjusted for demographics, comorbidity, and substance use. RESULTS:: Of note, 858 AMIs (42% HIV+) occurred over 5.9 years (median). Prevalence of optimal cardiac health was <2%. Optimal CVDRF profile was associated with the lowest adjusted AMI rates. Compared with HIV-veterans, AMI rates among HIV+ veterans with similar CVDRF profiles were higher. Compared with HIV-veterans without major CVDRFs, HIV+ veterans without major CVDRFs had a 2-fold increased risk of AMI (HR: 2.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.0 to 3.9; P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS:: The prevalence of optimal cardiac health is low in this cohort. Among those without major CVDRFs, HIV+ veterans have twice the AMI risk. Compared with HIV-veterans with high CVDRF burden, AMI rates were still higher in HIV+ veterans. Preventing/reducing CVDRF burden may reduce excess AMI risk among HIV+ people.","CAS Registry Numbers: 57-88-5 (cholesterol); Entry Week: 201507; Copyright 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",http://journals.lww.com/jaids/pages/default.aspx; http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed12&AN=2015708721; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Embase&id=pmid:&id=10.1097%2FQAI.0000000000000419&issn=1525-4135&isbn=&volume=68&issue=2&spage=209&pages=209-216&date=2015&title=Journal+of+Acquired+Immune+Deficiency+Syndromes&atitle=HIV+infection%2C+cardiovascular+disease+risk+factor+profile%2C+and+risk+for+acute+myocardial+infarction&aulast=Paisible&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,VACS,USA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No overall statistics,,,133960,,4.9

Although it has been shown that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults are at greater risk for aging-associated events, it remains unclear as to whether these events happen at similar, or younger ages, in HIV-infected compared with uninfected adults. The objective of this study was to compare the median age at, and risk of, incident diagnosis of 3 age-associated diseases in HIV-infected and demographically similar uninfected adults. Methods. The study was nested in the clinical prospective Veterans Aging Cohort Study of HIV-infected and demographically matched uninfected veterans, from 1 April 2003 to 31 December 2010. The outcomes were validated diagnoses of myocardial infarction (MI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and non-AIDS-defining cancer (NADC). Differences in mean age at, and risk of, diagnosis by HIV status were estimated using multivariate linear regression models and Cox proportional hazards models, respectively. Results. A total of 98 687 (31% HIV-infected and 69% uninfected) adults contributed >450 000 person-years and 689 MI, 1135 ESRD, and 4179 NADC incident diagnoses. Mean age at MI (adjusted mean difference, -0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], -.59 to .37 years) and NADC (adjusted mean difference, -0.10 [95% CI, -.30 to .10] years) did not differ by HIV status. HIV-infected adults were diagnosed with ESRD at an average age of 5.5 months younger than uninfected adults (adjusted mean difference, -0.46 [95% CI, -.86 to -.07] years). HIV-infected adults had a greater risk of all 3 outcomes compared with uninfected adults after accounting for important confounders. Conclusions. HIV-infected adults had a higher risk of these age-associated events, but they occurred at similar ages than those without HIV.",Update Code: 20150401,http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/4/627.full; http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=cagh&AN=20153094116; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Global+Health&id=pmid:&id=10.1093%2Fcid%2Fciu869&issn=1058-4838&isbn=&volume=60&issue=4&spage=627&pages=627-638&date=2015&title=Clinical+Infectious+Diseases&atitle=Comparison+of+risk+and+age+at+diagnosis+of+myocardial+infarction%2C+end-stage+renal+disease%2C+and+non-AIDS-defining+cancer+in+HIV-infected+versus+uninfected+adults.&aulast=Althoff&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,VACS,USA,Cohort study,MediCare/ IHD Quality Enhancement Initiative,ICD-9,Veterans,,48,2003,2010,Incidence - MI,,RR,0,,1.58,,,Calculated RR,,,27253,,5.3

Without demographically and behaviorally similar uninfected comparators and without uniformly measured clinical data on risk factors and fatal and nonfatalAMIevents, any potential association between HIV status and AMI may be confounded. Objective: To investigate whether HIV is associated with an increased risk of AMI after adjustment for all standard Framingham risk factors among a large cohort of HIV-positive and demographically and behaviorally similar (ie, similar prevalence of smoking, alcohol, and cocaine use) uninfected veterans in care. Design and Setting: Participants in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study Virtual Cohort from April 1, 2003, through December 31, 2009. Participants: After eliminating those with baseline cardiovascular disease, we analyzed data on HIV status, age, sex, race/ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, smoking, hepatitis C infection, body mass index, renal disease, anemia, substance use, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA, antiretroviral therapy, and incidence of AMI. Main Outcome Measure: Acute myocardial infarction. Results: We analyzed data on 82 459 participants. During a median follow-up of 5.9 years, there were 871 AMI events. Across 3 decades of age, the mean (95% CI) AMI events per 1000 person-years was consistently and significantly higher for HIV-positive compared with uninfected veterans: for those aged 40 to 49 years, 2.0 (1.6- 2.4) vs 1.5 (1.3-1.7); for those aged 50 to 59 years, 3.9 (3.3-4.5) vs 2.2 (1.9-2.5); and for those aged 60 to 69 years, 5.0 (3.8-6.7) vs 3.3 (2.6-4.2) (P<.05 for all). After adjusting for Framingham risk factors, comorbidities, and substance use, HIV-positive veterans had an increased risk of incident AMI compared with uninfected veterans (hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.27-1.72). An excess risk remained among those achieving an HIV-1 RNA level less than 500 copies/mL compared with uninfected veterans in time-updated analyses (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.17-1.66). Conclusions and Relevance: Infection with HIV is associated with a 50% increased risk of AMI beyond that explained by recognized risk factors. â© 2013 American Medical Association.","CAS Registry Numbers: 50-36-2 (cocaine); 53-21-4 (cocaine); 5937-29-1 (cocaine); 37205-61-1 (proteinase inhibitor); Entry Week: 201319; Copyright 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/INTEMED/926854/iiq130112_614_622.pdf; http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&AN=2013270392; http://openurl.ac.uk/athens:_edu//lfp/LinkFinderPlus/Display?sid=OVID:Embase&id=pmid:&id=10.1001%2Fjamainternmed.2013.3728&issn=2168-6106&isbn=&volume=173&issue=8&spage=614&pages=614-622&date=2013&title=JAMA+Internal+Medicine&atitle=HIV+infection+and+the+risk+of+acute+myocardial+infarction&aulast=Freiberg&pid=<author><p15/></author>&<AN><p16/></AN>,1,VACS-VC,USA,Cohort study,MediCare/ IHD Quality Enhancement Initiative,ICD-9/ICD-10,ART+,97.3,48.2,2003,2009,MI,,HR,1,"age, sex, ethnicity, Framingham risk score, statins, HCV infection",1.57,1.37,1.8,IRR of different age groups available,,,27350,,5.9

Whether HIV is an independent risk factor for CVD in women has not yet been established. Methods and Results-We analyzed data from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study on 2187 women (32% HIV infected [HIV+]) who were free of CVD at baseline. Participants were followed from their first clinical encounter on or after April 01, 2003 until a CVD event, death, or the last follow-up date (December 31, 2009). The primary outcome was CVD (acute myocardial infarction [AMI], unstable angina, ischemic stroke, and heart failure). CVD events were defined using clinical data, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes, and/or death certificate data. We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association between HIV and incident CVD, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, lipids, smoking, blood pressure, diabetes, renal disease, obesity, hepatitis C, and substance use/abuse. Median follow-up time was 6.0 years. Mean age at baseline of HIV+ and HIV uninfected (HIV-) women was 44.0 versus 43.2 years (P) women was 44.0 versus 43.2 years (P+): AMI, 13%; unstable angina, 8%; ischemic stroke, 22%; and heart failure, 57%.
